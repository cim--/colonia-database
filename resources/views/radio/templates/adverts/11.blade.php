<p>Planning a long trip away, but tired of eating from Food Cartridges? Vitto's mini-hydroponics kit is what you need! It uses the same technology pioneered in Colonia's agricultural orbitals to feed an entire region, but shrunk down to fit inside a ship's hold. Fully operation in both zero-G and standard gravity, a Vitto Mini-Hydroponics kit will produce enough grain, fruit and vegetables to feed six people, for as long as you keep it supplied.</p>

<p>Vitto's. Just Add Water.</p>
