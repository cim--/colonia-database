<p>When we were fleeing the Thargoids, Colonia helped us. Now, help us help those who are still fleeing, by joining the Colonia Refugee Society. We raise funds to get people back on their feet, work on construction projects to expand living space at our stations, and let people in the Sol region know that escape is possible.</p>

<p>Join us at our headquarters in Exodus Reach today, or at our branch offices in Safe Haven, Amber Dock, Berman Market or Millennium Point.</p>
