  Looking for a break? Then book a tour on the "January 92", the
  region's most popular tourist liner. In collaboration with the Blue
  Star Line, we run a ten week tour of many of the distant settlements
  on the Colonia Highway.

<p>
  You'll see the furthest reaches of Colonia territory at Hillary
  Depot, before a trip to the spectacular Lagoon Nebula and Amundsen
  Terminal. After that, we go on to Sacaqawea Space Port in the
  Skaudai Nebula where you can meet the archaeologists excavating the
  nearby Guardian ruins and take a shuttle out to see them yourself,
  before visiting the popular outposts of Gandharvi and Kashyapa to
  buy souvenirs and to meet up with other travellers and explorers.

  Between destinations, relax in our award-winning on board
  facilities, with spas, pools, restaurants, bars and more in both
  zero-G and a range of standard gravities.
