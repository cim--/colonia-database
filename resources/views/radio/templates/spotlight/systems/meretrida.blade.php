<p>The Eol Prou Group, Colonia's first major organisation to be structured under traditional corporate lines, set up the Dezhnev Landing factories as part of the Colonia Expansion Initiative, extending their industrial capabilities soon after with the Sojourner Bastion facility.</p>
<p>Meretrida's rapid production of medicines and water purifiers was essential during Colonia's early development to end serious outbreaks at the Metztli hydroponics laboratory. The Eol Prou Group now also runs security operations in the Metztli system, and has been able to significantly reduce the number of outbreaks there.</p>
<p>The group led the Hyponia Horizons survey mission in early 3303, which provided a full outline of the Hyponia region to cartographics databases. While the region remains impenetrable, its outline is now very well known.</p>
<p>Unlike many of Colonia's early organisations, the Eol Prou Group did not have established partners in the Sol bubble, and so in 3304 set up a branch organisation specialising in mining and refinery operation around the Gabri system, to allow it to benefit from long range opportunities.</p>
