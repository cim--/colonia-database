<p>The Saraswati system was founded by Saraswati Tourist Services on behalf of the Council to provide additional accommodation for visitors to the region, as it became a popular tourist destination. Commercial facilities were constructed at the Artutanov's Reach outpost in June 3303 to develop the system further.</p>
<p>So far, two installations have been constructed in the system. A Tourist Installation was built in June 3304 to provide a range of visitor facilities, followed by the Bug's Rest Civilian Installation in December 3304 to provide additional accommodation for both visitors and local workers.</p>
<p>The system has no major tourist attractions of its own, but has excellent views of the nebula and its dim M-class star provides minimal interference for stargazers. The NFH-183 science vessel also visits the system regularly for outreach purposes.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists have noted the similarity of the system name to the old GCS Sarasvati Thargoid surveillance vessel, though as with all systems in the region no signs of Thargoid activity have ever been found. The naming of Bug's Rest, however, only further encouraged their claims.</p>
