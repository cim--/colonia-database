<p>Deriso is the region's largest agricultural system, using advanced hydroponics to produce a large range of goods. The primary Giles Station is where most of the public facilities are, while the Talalay Retreat outpost, constructed a few months later, is mainly used for bulk commodity storage and may have better prices available.</p>
<p>The system's majority share of agricultural output means that it is a significant risk for the region, and the repeated partial shutdowns due to outbreaks of disease are likely to have been strongly considered by the Tir Research Labs when they recommended the construction of further substantial agricultural facilities in Kinesi.</p>
<p>Improvements to local quarantine facilities have been of limited effectiveness in preventing the outbreaks entirely, as the system's central location means that it attracts a large volume of traffic and potential contamination – however, they have succeeded in preventing the outbreaks spreading beyond the system. In June 3304 a further Agricultural facility was constructed around Deriso 2c to provide additional resilience and hydroponics space, however quarantine concerns led to its exclusion from the megaship logisitics routes. Goods must first be transported in smaller ships – where they can be more easily inspected – to other distribution centres.</p>
<p>The system's governance is of minor note, as it consisted for some time entirely of Cooperative organisations. While Cooperative organisations are the most common in the region, Deriso is the only system to have been exclusively governed in this fashion for an extended length of time – from its founding in June 3303 to June 3306 when Societas Eruditorum de Civitas Dei replaced the Colonia Agricultural Cooperative.</p>
