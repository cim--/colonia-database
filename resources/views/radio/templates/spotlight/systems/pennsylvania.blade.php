<p>Pennsylvania is one of the region's oldest systems, originally settled to supplement the raw materials provided by asteroid miners with a more consistent planetary supply, allowing the start of the Colonia Expansion Initiative.</p>
<p>The system is rich in valuable minerals, both in the ring systems of its outer gas giants and the surfaces of its planets, with particularly strong reserves of Bauxite, Coltan and Silver extracted by The Pit outpost from its second planet.</p>
<p>Despite its early strategic importance, the system faced many early problems due to its harsh environment, with members of the Colonia Mining Co-operative originally set up to run the system boycotting operations entirely on safety grounds for much of 3303. The Colonia Research Division was brought in to investigate increased automation, and also constructed a surface settlement Santos Mines on an outer moon to provide a break from zero-G for workers.</p>
<p>The Mining Cooperative returned to work in November of 3303, with administration of the public system facilities carried out by the separate Consortium Pioneers organisation. This did not mark an end to the system's troubles, however, as The Pit was disabled for two weeks in January 3304, after the No Look Here Gang tried to smuggle Thargoid artifacts through the system.</p>
<p>Nowadays the system is less significant economically, with several larger mining systems nearby, although it does still contain good opportunities for smaller independent asteroid miners. In September 3305 uncertainty following a disputed election led to the No Look Here Gang seizing control of the system, with order only being restored in the following February when it was placed under direct control of the Colonia Council. Damage caused in the
fighting to retake the system has led to the system’s infrastructure
suffering regular failures since, leading to significant dissatisfaction
in the system’s small population.</p>
