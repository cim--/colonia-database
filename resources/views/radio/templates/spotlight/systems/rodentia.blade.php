<p>The Fuel Rats rose to early prominence as the galaxy's most famous rescue organisation in late 3301 shortly after the development of the Fuel Transfer Limpet, and were heavily involved in the refuelling of Jaques Station before its attempted jump to Beagle Point. Once the station was rediscovered, the usefulness of the Colonia settlements as a base for deep space rescues was clear, and through the Colonia Expansion Initiative they founded the Rodentia system.</p>
<p>The High-Tech base of Surly's Nest specialises in Bioreducing Lichen and Microbial Furnaces, crucial to keeping the metal processing of Colonia running, and keeping the Fuel Rats supplied with limpets. A few lightweight limpet controllers are also available locally for emergency fitting, though more recent developments in the region mean that the rescue ships are usually built nearby.</p>
<p>The Rodentia system also contains a rare ringed earth-like world, which as with others in the region is off limits to habitation to protect the native life.</p>
