<p>When the damaged Jaques Station was first discovered, a group of explorers was one of the larger teams hauling repair supplies out from the bubble. As the situation stabilised, and thoughts turned to settlement in the nebula, they formed the Colonia Citizens Network, and organised further supply convoys to the growing region, as well as mapping and survey projects of the local region.</p>
<p>Their early operations were largely nomadic, and often in the uninhabited spaces between the settled systems, but as Colonia itself transitioned from the rush of early settlement to removing its reliance on the bubble, they founded the Phoenix Harbour settlement in the metal-rich Centralis system, providing additional raw materials to the local economy.</p>
<p>A year later, in July 3304, they obtained the Damask Rose, a small civilian cruiser, and placed it in orbit around the A7a moon. The ship sells a small amount of ores but mainly consists of hangar space for local pilots. Rumours connect this ship's arrival to Zachary Rackham's charitable donation, which allowed planetary shipyards and hangars to be developed throughout the region.</p>
<p>In keeping with the exploration focus of the group's founders, the Centralis system has been the destination of several expeditions, including the Beagle Point Expedition of 3304, and two anniversary convoys bringing symbolic supplies from the bubble.</p>
