<p>The Edge Fraternity established this system as part of the Colonia Expansion Initiative, with accommodation set up at the Concordia Hub surface port. Placed in a valley between several mountains, it was well placed to observe the spectacular refraction through the ice at sunrise and sunset, and developed one of the region's early tourism industries.</p>

<p>As the A 10 gas giant has orbited the star, the port itself has been locked in permanent night for several months - however, there are many other sites on the planet where the ice peaks can be observed at twilight, and sightseeing continues.</p>
<p>The Edge Fraternity are one of Colonia's many exploration-focused groups, and the system formed part of the routes of the Summer Great Expedition in mid-3303.</p>
<p>The system is currently under the control of the Last Phoenix Vault, securing the region in the aftermath of the Third Regional Conflict. As this followed a period of direct administrative control by ColoniaCouncil following the victory of traditionalist candidates in elections during November 3305, and a brief attempted takeover by the Likedeeler of Colonia, the systemâ€™s political position remainsslightly unstable, though this is not expected to affect tourist travel to the system.</p>
