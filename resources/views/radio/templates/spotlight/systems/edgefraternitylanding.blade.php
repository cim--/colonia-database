<p>The Edge Fraternity established this system as part of the Colonia Expansion Initiative, with accommodation set up at the Concordia Hub surface port. Placed in a valley between several mountains, it was well placed to observe the spectacular refraction through the ice at sunrise and sunset, and developed one of the region's early tourism industries.</p>

<p>As the A 10 gas giant has orbited the star, the port itself has been locked in permanent night for several months - however, there are many other sites on the planet where the ice peaks can be observed at twilight, and sightseeing continues.</p>
<p>The Edge Fraternity are one of Colonia's many exploration-focused groups, and the system formed part of the routes of the Summer Great Expedition in mid-3303.</p>
<p>The system is currently under the direct administrative control of Colonia Council following the victory of traditionalist candidates in elections during November 3305, though this is not expected to affect tourist travel to the system.</p>
