<p>McDonald Platform, named after the quasi-mythical agricultural pioneer, is so far the only Colonia facility to be constructed within the nebula itself. A hydroponics station to provide additional capacity and resilience to Colonia's food provision as the region expanded, it specialises in high-end goods such as Animal Meat, Coffee and Tea which are growable in the confines of an outpost.</p>
<p>In June 3304 the capacity was expanded with the construction of an extra agricultural installation, and the system is on the route of two supply ships which bring supplies and move its food to other central systems such as Alberta and Tir.</p>
<p>The station was disabled for a week in August 3304 after it was used to smuggle Thargoid artifacts. Meta-alloys were quickly brought up from the bubble to repair the damage, and no permanent harm was done. With safe isolation of Thargoid technology developed in late 3304, it is likely to be the last Colonia station to be affected this way.</p>
<p>Like many nebula systems, it is home to the local umbrella molluscs and other native life. The system also has three terraformable worlds which are likely to be key sites for future expansion of the settlement: partially shielded from the higher levels of radiation near the galactic core by the material of the nebula, they are the most likely sites for existing bubble-developed terraforming technology to work without extensive modification.</p>
