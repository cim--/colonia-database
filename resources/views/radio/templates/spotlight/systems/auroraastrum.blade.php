<p>The Colonists of Aurora established the mining settlement of Prisma Renata on one of the inner planets of this spectacular system, rich in Cobalt and Silver. An additional facility, Napier Laboratory, provides research support to the miners.</p>
<p>While the presence of heavy industry means that the system is not generally on tourism routes, it nevertheless has spectacular sights, with Aurora Astrum 3's substantial rings lit by the bright F-class star. Transits of the star by an inner gas giant, close enough to be visible without magnification, are a regular occurrence. More colourful sights can be seen further out, with some lagrange clouds and their inhabitants in the outer system.</p>
<p>The Colonists are closely related to the Prismatic Imperium group, and the bright environment near the star is said to be ideal for showing off Gutamaya ships and other reminders of their friends in the Empire. The group itself, however, is structured along cooperative lines which even reformists such as Aisling Duval might consider a step too far back home, and has no formal connections with the Empire.</p>
<p>Security and facilities management system has been a matter of occasional controversy in the system, with officials from nearby Canonnia being elected to temporarily manage the system between April and July 3303, and the system unexpectedly voting to be placed under direct collective control of the Colonia Council in July 3305, before the Likedeeler of Colonia took on security responsibilities at the start of 3306.</p>
