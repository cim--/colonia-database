<p>The Order of the Wandering Siamese founded the Neon Sanctuary base as a place for the protection of cats and other felines. Unsurprisingly, this makes it a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the region. While Neon Sanctuary itself is safely placed away from seismic activity, the planet as a whole is somewhat geologically active, and side trips to the volcanism sites can also be made.</p>
<p>The system has been subject to occasional political instability due to the Order’s usual disinterest in politics, with temporary administration under several other organisations for much of its operation. While currently under the Order’s control, security has at various times also been run by Infinity’s End Deep Space Company,the Likedeeler of Colonia, the Colonia Citizens’ Network, Pioneers and Explorers, and Nu Simbad, making it for now the system with the most distinct security controllers.</p>
<p>In July 3306 the system’s feline population and monastic nature made it the natural destination for an exploration expedition carried out by the Church of the Space Cat.</p>
