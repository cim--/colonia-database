<p>The original refinery system of Colonia, named after an ancient metalworking deity, the Malik Station outpost in this system was for several months the region's only local source of refined metals, and was intentionally positioned between the early extraction outposts at Pennsylvania and Desy for ease of transportation.</p>
<p>While larger refineries such as those at Kojeara, Luchtaine or Sollaro now provide the majority of Colonia's metals, Hephaestus has retained some importance due to its convenient position, at the centre of a cluster of several extraction systems, and its efficient processing of both metals and more complex materials.</p>
<p>Millennium Point, constructed in April 3304 to house refugees from the Thargoid attacks on the bubble, orbits further out, above the Longyear Beacon mining base. Like many of Colonia's smaller outposts, this station primarily runs a service economy to make best use of the available space.</p>
<p>An Industrial installation has also been placed around the distant secondary Hephaestus B star, providing additional storage for mined ores, as well as extra refining capacity.</p>
