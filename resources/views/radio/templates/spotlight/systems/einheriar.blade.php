<p>Pilkington Orbital was established in mid 3303 as part of Colonia's move to economic self-sufficiency. It uses the hydroponics technology common to most of Colonia's agricultural economies to generate food without damaging local environments, specialising in fruit and vegetables - and their alcoholic derivatives.</p>
<p>The Paxton Landing service outpost was added soon after to help coordination of Einheriar's activity with the rest of the region, and also to provide additional space for the region's rapidly growing service sector, with an Agricultural installation added later to provide further hydroponics facilities.</p>
<p>When hundreds of thousands of refugees arrived from the bubble, fleeing the initial Thargoid attacks, Einheriar was used as a temporary shelter for them. Substantial quantities of construction materials were brought to Pilkington Orbital in late 3303, providing modular accommodation which was later rearranged into the five permanent outposts in Ratraii, Alberta, Carcosa, Hephaestus and Trakath.</p>
<p>This construction operation was the first real test of the capacities of Colonia's new economic arrangements, and despite some supply-line challenges, threats from pirates, and the system's position on the edge of the region, it was a full success with around one million tonnes of cargo hauled.</p>
<p>Security provision and station management in the Einheriar system were interrupted in late 3305 as a consequence of the conflict in the nearby Carcosa system disrupting local elections. Einheriar Agri-Works Ltd and Explorers' Nation entered into a power-sharingagreement for several months. A fresh election in January 3306 appeared to resolve the matter in favour of Explorersâ€™ Nation, but in May 3306 their majority collapsed and a coalition of Einheriar Agri-Works Ltd and Colonia Council took control from June 3306 onwards, before it was placed under Societas Eruditorum military rule in the battles to contain the Nameless during the Third Regional Conflict</p>
