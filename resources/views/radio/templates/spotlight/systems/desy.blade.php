<p>When the original wave of outposts was constructed, the largest of them was Morten's Paradise at Desy, which until the first surface settlements were built was the highest population system in the region. Orbiting an earth-like world, its operations were initially focused on extraction of minerals from that planet's moon, with the Beaumont Reach facility constructed there soon after to improve capacity.</p>
<p>The early prospecting of the system turned out to have been optimistic, however, and other than reasonable production of Lepidolite and Silver, the system is less mineral-rich than originally expected. With no gas giant rings or major asteroid clusters, there is also little opportunity for independent pilots to supplement its production.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the system retained some importance due to its location, and formed part of the security provision dispute between the Mobius Colonial Republic Navy (MCRN) and the Privateers Alliance Expeditionary Force (PAEX) in late 3303 and early 3304, eventually resolved with MCRN taking responsibility for security in this system, while PAEX manage the nearby Alberta system.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of the dispute in mid 3304, the Council began steps to move the system towards an agricultural economy, setting up a hydroponics installation around the fourth planet. At this stage, this installation is mostly for local production, though a Hogan Class cargo ship and a Naphtha Class tanker are used to transfer surplus to Hamlet's Harmony for repackaging and sale.</p>
