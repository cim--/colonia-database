<p>The Rock Rats had a long tradition of exo-geology by the time of Jaques' misjump, having helped prospect planets for both the Distant Worlds and Crab Nebula expedition fleets, and providing enough information to allow the refinement of the standard surface scanners for mineral detection.</p>
<p>When Colonia was founded, they contributed extensively to the mining operations needed for early resources, carefully mapping the metallic belt clusters around Colonia to provide it with the Palladium reserves which funded initial development.</p>
<p>As the Colonia Expansion Initiative continued to grow the region, they contributed funding to the construction of Rock Rats Reach in this system on the outskirts of Colonia. With many mineral-rich worlds and ring systems around the young stars, it provides valuable raw materials, as well as opportunities for further exo-geological research.</p>
<p>Like many of the region's extraction systems, the system also includes many outstanding sights â€“ from Rock Rats Reach on Rodentia Petram A7 there is a continuous view of the planet's substantial ring system, as well as often being able to see its small moon, and the nearby A6 gas giant, close enough to see its rings unaided as well.</p>
