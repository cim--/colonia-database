<p>Tir was one of the systems settled a year after Colonia's initial founding to move the economy to self-sufficiency. Bolden's Enterprise was set up as a high-tech manufacturing centre, specialising in the HE Suits and Structural Regulators needed for safe maintenance of the regions many surface bases, but also providing a wide range of other goods.</p>
<p>In July 3303 the system was expanded further with the Dohler Depot service outpost, and the diversification of the economy combined with its proximity to Colonia made the Tir system a natural site for further high-tech developments.</p>
<p>The Council were able to attract a technology broker to Bolden's Enterprise in February 3304, providing more specialist equipment to the region, and in June 3304 made the choice to construct major research facilities in the system. Led by Professor Alexei de la Vega, the Tir Research Labs monitor the overall health of the Colonia region, recommending interventions to ensure Colonia can continue to grow sustainably.</p>
<p>Tir is also famous for its applied research, with The Watchtower surface laboratories on the surface of Tir A2. Led by Marsha Hicks, a refugee from the Thargoid attacks on the bubble, they provide enhanced mining equipment and kinetic weapons to the region's pilots, as well as for larger extraction and refining operations.</p>
<p>The strategic importance of the system led to an extended dispute between the Colonia Citizens Network (CCN) and Simple Elite Corps (SEC) groups over security provision in February 3305, which was eventually resolved in favour of CCN.</p>
