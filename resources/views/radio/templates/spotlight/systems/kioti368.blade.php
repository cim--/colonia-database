<p>The Privateers’ Alliance set up the Kioti 368 system – named after the explorer and trader Don Kioti, and the HIP 33368 system that is their original home – early in the history of Colonia. Over five thousand tonnes of supplies were hauled from the bubble personally by Commander ElvisKremmen, in whose honour the system’s main settlement is named.</p>
<p>For the first two years of settlement, the system was almost entirely residential, providing accommodation on the edge of the region to settlers. A small extraction base – Fukui’s Pride – produced basic materials for local use, but did not contribute significantly economically.</p>
<p>In March 3305, to reinforce Colonia’s self-sufficiency, high-tech manufacturing facilities were constructed at Kremmen’s Respite. In keeping with the identification of food security and defence as regional priorities, there is a particular specialisation in Battle Weapons, Reactive Armour, and Land Enrichment Systems.</p>
