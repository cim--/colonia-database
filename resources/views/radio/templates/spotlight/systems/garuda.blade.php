<p>The Galcop organisation, a coalition of several smaller groups, took its name from the Galactic Cooperative of Worlds two centuries previously. Well known at the time of the Colonia Expansion Initiative for its close fight in the bubble with the forces loyal to Yuri Grom, its Colonia Defence Commission arm established the region's first military base at Vera Rubin Complex in February 3303, and added further barracks facilities at Cavendish Base a few months later.</p>
<p>The group's leadership drafted the original Jaques Accords, which while nowadays largely superseded by other diplomatic arrangements were crucial in the early days of Colonia's development to keep the the numerous and diverse organisations of the Colonia Expansion Initiative from coming into open conflict, as well as affirming the crucial role of Jaques himself in managing the region's capital.</p>
<p>Vera Rubin Complex is in a large volcanic crater on a close binary moon, and its unique setting and challenging approach meant that it was chosen as one of the stops on the Colonia Trophy Dash race. In summer, the journey from the port to the edge of the crater by SRV has many spectacular sights.</p>
