<p>The Asura system was settled as part of the region's move to self-sufficiency, and is by a considerable margin the region's largest economy, containing both its largest industrial operation at Mizuno Dock, and its most profitable services centre at Wellington's Claim.</p>
<p>The factories of Mizuno Dock were crucial to the success of Colonia's establishment of hydroponics facilities in 3304, with their proximity to the temporary logistics centre at Randgnid and their high production capacity meaning that they contributed around 20% of the total equipment. Production was sufficiently fast that a freighter could load up, fly to Randgnid and back, and have the next batch waiting for it on its return.</p>
<p>The ready access to components and the presence of Colonia's only specialist medical installation made Asura the choice of the engineer Petra Olmanova when she set up the Sanctuary base in August 3304. Specialising primarily in defenses and countermeasures, her enhancements are valued by Colonia's military and exploration fleets alike.</p>
<p>Positioned on the edge of the nebula, the system also has the conditions necessary for the local umbrella molluscs, who can be found near the 1f moon, along with the simpler spherical and crystalline structures made by microorganisms.</p>
