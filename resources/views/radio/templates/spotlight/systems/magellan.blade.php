<p>Magellan is one of the first wave of systems founded through the Colonia Expansion Initiative. Its founders, the Pioneers and Explorers, were one of several groups recognising the value to explorers of establishing a strong settlement relatively close to the centre of the galaxy.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Colonia Council were keen to encourage increased tourism income for the region – at the time, visitors to the repaired Jaques Station provided a significant proportion of the young settlement’s funds, and it was recognised that further facilities would be needed to sustain this income.</p>
<p>Walhalla Port was therefore established on the surface of Magellan C1, with spectacular views of both the nearby red dwarf star and the Colonia nebula, as well as local tours of the planet’s volcanic vents. Additional accommodation was added a few months later at Rae’s Prospect.</p>
<p>The main tourist draw, however, is Magellan itself – an active neutron star, and the only one in an inhabited Colonia system.  Visitors are able to view the remnant as they arrive, before being transported in luxury to the safely-distant facilities around Magellan C.</p>
<p>For longer-range travel and exploration, Magellan has also become popular as a departure point towards the galactic centre, forming a natural entry point to the well-charted neutron star network around Colonia.</p>
