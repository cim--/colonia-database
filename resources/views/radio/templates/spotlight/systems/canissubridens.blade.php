<p>One of the early disputes in Colonia's history was whether the region should be a dedicated base for exploration and research, or a more generalised settlement. The Smiling Dingo Crew played a significant part in deciding this argument in favour of generalism, by demonstrating the unsustainability of the purely exploration consortia, although their methods were controversial and reflected the group's criminal ethos.</p>
<p>In the process, they set up a settlement at the Bone Yard, strikingly placed on top of a mountain and only practical to approach by air. Further developments placed refinery operations here to support the nearby mining in Signalis and Far Tauri, as well as constructing the Naboth Arsenal military base.</p>
<p>Objectors to their methods took advantage of the group's lax approach to smuggling by disabling the port with Thargoid materials in May 3303 - the first such attack to succeed in Colonia. A period of security instability in the system followed, with various organisations temporarily managing system security for weeks or months, until the Crew were able to regain more sustained control in October 3304.</p>
