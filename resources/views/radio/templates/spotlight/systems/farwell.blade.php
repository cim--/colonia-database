<p>The Farwell system is Coloniaâ€™s newest Tourism site, founded by the Phoenix Industries organisation at the end of the Colonia Expansion Initiative. The system is on the upper edge of the region, a long way from the nebula, and so has excellent views of the galaxy and nearby open clusters.</p>
<p>While the system has a large number of geologically-active bodies for volcanism tours, the main attractions are the museums at the settlement, which are dedicated to the progress of technology from early human endeavours to the latest cutting-edge designs developed in Colonia itself.</p>
