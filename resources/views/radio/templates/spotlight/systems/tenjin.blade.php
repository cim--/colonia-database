<p>While the majority of the initial outposts were dedicated to starting Colonia's own economy, Tenjin was the exception. Balakor's Research Post was set up to carry out initial research of the nebula and surrounding regions, both to answer the urgent immediate question of whether there was any threat to settlement hidden within the nebula, and then to carry out a more general research programme to take advantage of its proximity.</p>
<p>With suspicions - since confirmed - that the initial misjump was caused by Thargoid technology, Balakor's Research Post was placed in orbit around an ammonia world. However, while home to various forms of life, no sign of Thargoid technology was found - instead, the nebula is home to various species of space life, with the umbrella molluscs being the most distinctive.</p>
<p>At the time, the Colonia nebula was only the second to be settled, with the earlier settlements in the much smaller and less dense Pleiades nebula not yet expanded by AEGIS to their current size. Concerns over potential risks and the difficulty in surveying the nebula led to the Council not carrying out settlement beyond its fringes for almost a year. Even now, Hamlet's Harmony remains the only inhabited system at any significant depth, as the conclusion that it was safe to go deeper into the nebula was only reached after the majority of settlement was already planned.</p>
<p>Tenjin continues to be a key system for scientific research, with an additional installation constructed at Tenjin 6, but has also diversified into tourism, with a small settlement on Tenjin 1 providing good views of the nebula as well as sightseeing tours of the ammonia world. Its position close to Colonia has also made it a convenient secondary logistics hub, with three of the region's logistics vessels passing through the system.</p>
<p>In early 3306, a series of natural disasters damaged critical infrastructure in the system, causing major civil unrest among the small population. The Bloodhounds administration, who had 
controlled the system since September 3304, were challenged in an election by both previous controllers – Colonia Research Department and Galcop Colonial Defence Commission – with Galcop winning the vote in May 3306, and Bloodhounds ceasing its partnership with the system a few weeks later. So far, while Galcop’s second tenure has brought greater political stability, they have not yet been able to resolve the system’s infrastructure issues.</p>
