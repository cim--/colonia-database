<p>Benzaiten is the headquarters of Colonia Tourism & Co, the first partner organisation of the Council to explicitly focus on tourism for the region as a whole - though others had run individual tourist sites earlier at Amatsuboshi, Magellan and Edge Fraternity Landing.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Benzaiten itself has the largest facilities for tourist accommodation. Most tourists stay in hotels in the luxurious Bisley Landing starport, though much of the system's commercial needs are managed through the Zhu Oasis outpost.</p>
<p>As well as providing convenient accommodation, entertainment is provided by the major facility around Benzaiten 8, where guests can experience entertainment in both the new Colonia styles, or for the less adventurous, many of the greatest hits of the bubble.</p>
<p>The Benzaiten system is not itself a major draw for the sightseeing tourist, though it does have an excellent overhead view of the Colonia nebula and an unobstructed view of the galactic plane, as well as a few impressive ice geyser sites.</p>
