<p>The Canonn scientific research organisation enthusiastically took the chance to establish a centre in the nebula, providing some early high-tech manufacturing expertise and facilities to the region at the Arcanonn's Legacy base, and adding further space at Keppler Observatory soon after.</p>
<p>Situated in the base of the planet’s largest impact crater, Arcanonn’s Legacy is tens of kilometres below the mean surface level, and combined with the high surface gravity, this makes for a long approach to the landing pads.</p>
<p>The settlements in the system, unusually for the region, orbit a distant secondary star, which allows convenient observations of the umbrella molluscs and metallic crystals in the rings of the gas giants by Canonn's xenobiological division.</p>
<p>Canonn's signals intelligence team, working with their colleagues in the bubble, were the first to reach Hyford's wreck following his assassination in late 3303. Despite their efforts, the unstable data core retrieved from the site has not yet been decoded.</p>
<p>While no longer as key to Colonia's high-tech economy as it once was, the system still produces a significant amount of the auto-fabricators and muon imager needed to keep Colonia's production running.</p>
<p>In early 3306, Arcanonn’s Legacy was used by the Corrosive Cargo Caravan to store research materials related to the Thargoid conflict safely away from the front lines.</p>
