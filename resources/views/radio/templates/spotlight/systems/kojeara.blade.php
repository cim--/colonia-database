<p>As the economy of Colonia grew with the first stages of the Colonia Expansion Initiative, the need for additional refinery facilities became urgent. The small facilities at Hephaestus were well over capacity, and the only surface refineries at the time were at Phoenix and the recently opened Santos Dumont.</p>
<p>A small moonlet of Kojeara 1 was hollowed out and converted into a large recycling facility, converting scrap and other waste back into useful metals, approximately tripling Colonia's refining capacity and boosting industrial production.</p>
<p>Kojeara was the site of the first major conflicts between Colonia's administrations and criminal organisations, with unauthorised installations being constructed in the outer systems soon after TolaGarf's opened. Two successful sweeps took place in May and June 3303 to contain their activity, and prevented disruption to major logistics activity in the system as part of Colonia's self-sufficiency project.</p>
<p>The logistics activity led to the construction of many additional outposts in the region, including the Oswald Park mining station in this system. The Gallite and Lepidolite produced by this outpost is often taken directly to the Junkyard, which with the maturing of Colonia's economy and the development of in-place material reclamation, no longer handles that much scrap.</p>
<p>In early 3304, the Council negotiated for a raw materials trader to set up in TolaGarf's Junkyard, and later in the year a hydroponics installation was constructed in the outer system to provide additional data to the nearby research at Metztli. Criminal activity centred around unauthorised installations still continues, though is largely contained by the system authorities.</p>
