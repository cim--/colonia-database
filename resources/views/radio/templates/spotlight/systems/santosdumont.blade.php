<p>Following the success of gravitic refining in Phoenix, the Council asked INO Research to set up a second facility in this nearby system, on the 6th planet. Brazilian Dream takes advantage of the 3G surface gravity to run an efficient refining operation. It is currently the highest gravity of any settled planet in the region.</p>
<p>The hot star means that the majority of the inner system consists of barren metallic worlds, but in the outer system an earthlike orbits a large water world. As with other earthlikes in the region this is currently a nature reserve and not economically exploited.</p>
<p>Security control of this system was disputed as part of the second regional conflict, with the Sovereignty taking control between 14 March 3304 and 20 July 3304. The regaining of control by INO Research marked the turning point in this conflict, with the Sovereignty then defeated in their other systems over the following months.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Dream surface base was chosen in 3305 to be one of the stops on the Colonia Trophy Dash race for its challenging high-gravity environment and spectacular rings.</p>
<p>In July and August 3306 the system saw heavy fighting between The Nameless and a Societas-led coalition as part of the third regional conflict, ending with the retreat of Nameless forces from the system.</p>
