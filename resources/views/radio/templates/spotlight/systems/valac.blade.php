<p>The Marquisate of Valac founded this industrial system as part of the Colonia Expansion Initiative, completing a cluster of surface manufacturing plants in this part of the region. Originally an Imperial religious tradition, persecution there led to their move to Colonia where they could practice without political interference. They are led by a council of “Magi” drawn from each of the former Imperial houses they descended from.</p>
<p>In keeping with the theocratic corporate outlook of the Marquisate, Salted Womb primarily produces essential goods - medicine, food cartridges, and a range of operational industrial tools - required for the basic maintenance of the region's settlements.</p>
<p>Valac is on the fringes of the nebula, and the local molluscs have been found at several sites in the system, including a rare appearance inside the ring system of Valac 2. The Lagrange Cloud near Valac 3c is a particularly dark one, and has been used to study the behaviour of the molluscs in low light environments.</p>
