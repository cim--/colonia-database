<p>When the initial settlements outside Colonia itself were set up, to begin moving to a self-sufficient economy, most of the stations were only small outposts. Ratraii was the exception - a surplus unfinished Coriolis station was obtained relatively cheaply, and installed close to the star.</p>
<p>To start with, the station's facilities were extremely limited - with no market or shipyard, Colonia Dream began as a backup landing platform only, and the scale of work involved in completing construction seemed huge. The majority of time was spent attempting - with limited success - to prevent the Brian's Thugs criminal gang disrupting attempts to mine construction materials, or gaining a foothold elsewhere in the nebula.</p>
<p>As the early surface stations of the Colonia Expansion Initiative became operational nearby, supplying the necessary equipment without extensive travel, progress improved. In April 3303, the market facilities were finally operational, and it became much easier to bring equipment in, with large quantities of mined metals being transferred between the 13 and 16 April.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, Colonia Dream was able to open its shipyards - the first major ones in the region - and begin production of many larger ship hulls and modules than the basics previously stocked at Jaques Station.</p>
<p>Ratraii's new importance as the region's fleet maintenance centre led to further development, with mining outposts opening at Bonestell Point in July 3303 and at Exodus Reach in April 3304 - the latter, to help house refugees from the Thargoid conflict, is embedded in a ring system for support of the system's own mining fleets. In June 3304, Brian's Thugs - having failed to gain much support either inside or outside the system - set up an industrial installation near Colonia Dream to provide additional support for mining operations.</p>
<p>As the economy of Ratraii grew, so did its shipyards, which by the start of 3305 were able to produce a very wide range of equipment, some rivalling the best of the Sol bubble's capabilities. In recent months the relatively small space available has meant that some of the most difficult constructions have been moved to the nearby Colonia system, but Ratraii retains major importance as an economic and fleet centre, as well as the home of a data brokerage service to obtain technical data for Colonia's engineers.</p>
