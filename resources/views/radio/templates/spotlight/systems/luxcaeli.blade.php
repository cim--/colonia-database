<p>The Infinity's End Deep Space Company, run by a hybrid of democratic and corporate governance methods, founded Tristan's Rest in October 3303 towards the end of the Colonia Expansion Initiative, after a shortage of bulk transports delayed their departure from the bubble compared with other 'wave 5' organisations.</p>
<p>Tristan's Rest provides additional nearby extraction for the local refineries at Kojeara and Luchtaine, specialising in Bauxite and Uraninite ores in particular.</p>
<p>In late 3305 the system was briefly and controversially placed under the administrative control of the nearby Pioneers and Explorers organisation. The Company retook control just over a month later, and argued that if consolidation of control is desirable, it would be better for Magellan to be under their control â€“ their opponents taking the point, the dispute was brought to a swift end.</p>
