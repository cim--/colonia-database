<p>The Ogmar system played a key role in Colonia's development even before it was inhabited, with the metallic belt cluster prospected and mined for Palladium by the Rock Rats to provide valuable tradeable goods to the Council.</p>
<p>High-tech manufacturing then began here in October 3302, with Dervish Platform supplying key equipment to the expansion efforts. When Colonia started producing its own ships and modules in April 3303, the facilities and population at Dervish were expanded, with a small settlement being constructed below on the moon's surface.</p>
<p>The sale of equipment to independent pilots meant that Ogmar, unlike many of the other initial systems, developed beyond its "startup" status, and the outpost's docking queues were regularly overcrowded. In December 3303, the Galcop Colonial Defence Commission, responsible for security matters in the system, therefore raised funding to build a new station - although, in the short term, bringing in the necessary commodities caused record queues at Dervish Platform for a week.</p>
<p>Whirling Station, a modern Coriolis design, opened a month later, with many more workers coming to the system to work in its factories. It is now one of Colonia's most visited stations, due to its large selection of ship components and thriving high-tech markets.</p>
<p>Ogmar is a wide binary system, with the distance of Ogmar B making it a popular choice for discreet criminal activity. Unauthorised constructions have been recorded there, where effective authority response is difficult.</p>
