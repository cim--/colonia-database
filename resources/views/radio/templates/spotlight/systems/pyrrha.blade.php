<p>The Interstellar Communist Union had a long history of promoting and spreading communist governments in the bubble, and constructed a surface port at Tsiolkovsky Horizon – named after the early rocketry pioneer – to continue this work in Colonia.</p>
<p>Originally planned as an agricultural hydroponics base using the research from Metztli, the technology was not ready in time, and it was instead set on improving the high-tech manufacturing needed to carry out the research. It remains one of the few places able to construct research limpet controllers, needed for study of the local molluscs as well as more general exploration. While regional specialisation into high-tech production has made it less crucial to the economy than it was, it is still a major producer of Advanced Medicines, Battle Weapons and Muon Imager.</p>
<p>While the specific structures of communism did not catch on widely in Colonia – the related cooperative form of government being far more common – many of the broad principles are compatible, and the ICU now manages station and system facilities in several of Colonia's major economic centres.</p>
