<p>Pekoe, positioned on the edge of the settled region, was originally founded primarily as a prison colony, as the main wave of expansion was coming to an end. For the first few months it was not recorded on official maps, and used for prisoners considered too high-risk for Chaydar Correctional. The nearest inhabited system – Lux Caeli – is 27.8 LY away, making Pekoe the most isolated system in the region, though this would change if plans to settle the nearby Eol Prou OH-K c9-245 system were to progress.</p>
<p>In April 3304 control of the system passed to the ICU Colonial Corps, who have since primarily run it for its agricultural facilities, constructing an additional installation for this purpose in June 3304. As the only inhabited brown dwarf system in the region, natural light is virtually non-existent, and so it provides an excellent demonstration of the effectiveness of Colonia's hydroponics technology.</p>
<p>A small number of high-risk prisoners are still housed in the system at classified locations, and for security reasons the only official landing site is the Jonas Station orbital outpost. The combination of the isolation and lack of major services ensures that Pekoe remains quiet with few visitors – though unlike comparable Sol region systems, it does not require a permit to visit.</p>
