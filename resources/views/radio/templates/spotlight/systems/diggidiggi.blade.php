<p>Colonia's largest extraction system, founded in July 3303 as part of the region's move to self-sufficiency. The primary station – the region’s first and so far only Ocellus – at Bascom's Pride was supplemented by the nearby Stein Works outpost, which handles the majority of cargo storage, and an Industrial installation slightly further from the star was constructed in June 3304 for additional capacity.</p>
<p>The system is nowadays primarily an exporter of Cobalt, Bauxite and Uraninite, which are found in large quantities in the planetary mines, but was in its early years a major producer of Palladium. Due to the high value of Palladium, the majority was not sold on the open market, but instead shipped in bulk to central systems such as Colonia or Ratraii, for further distribution through the main logistics networks. Similar contracts may still be obtained by independent pilots, though more rarely since the PDP-399 Tanker began serving the system.</p>
<p>Diggidiggi is currently unique among inhabited systems in the region in that all of its planets have at least some atmosphere, and therefore the surfaces are generally more protected from orbital debris.</p>
