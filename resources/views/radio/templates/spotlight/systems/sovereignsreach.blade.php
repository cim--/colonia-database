<p>The Sovereignty settled this system to construct Colonia's second military base, supporting nearby Garuda. The original plan was for it to be constructed deep within the nebula in Eol Prou RS-T d3-686, but at the time surveys of the nebula had not been completed and concerns over whether it held more sophisticated or dangerous life than the molluscs were widespread, and it was moved to this system on the fringes of the nebula instead.</p>
<p>A militaristic organisation, the Sovereignty triggered the region's second conflict by attempting to obtain security control over the Macrath, Randgnid, Phoenix and Santos Dumont systems during 3304. While they obtained temporary success in the first half of the year, opposition eventually led to them losing them again over the next few months, as well as control over the Sovereign's Reach system itself in October 3304.</p>
<p>In February 3305 they took back the system and Macrath from their temporary administrators, and accepted that as the extent of their security responsibilities.</p>
<p>The system's position close to Colonia makes it a minor logistics hub, and a common first destination for surplus goods transferred in from the edges of the region.</p>
