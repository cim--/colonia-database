<p>When the Council invited numerous partner organisations to operate new stations in June 3303, The Nameless took advantage of the large volumes of cargo transfers required to smuggle in some equipment of their own, and hollowed out a small moonlet around a volcanic world on the fringes of the region.</p>
<p>While they were successful in starting operations undetected, they were spotted by patrols from the nearby Union system soon after, and Robardin Rock was located. The improvised station had impressive stocks of ships and hardware – especially by the limited standards of Colonia outfitting.</p>
<p>Suspicion immediately arose that the organisation had a wealthy backer, though Colonia intelligence was unable to identify them, and their funding was sufficient to construct the auxiliary Aragon Silo outpost around an outer gas giant a month later.</p>
<p>In mid-October, under significant pressure from Explorers’ Nation patrols providing security forces to the system, their agenda was revealed, as they launched an audacious attack on Colonia itself, attempting to take control of Colonia Hub.</p>
<p>The Council fought back, calling independent pilots to its aid, and despite their resources, The Nameless were outnumbered an average of 15:1 in the battles around Colonia. Defeated, and with their funds exhausted, their influence fell away in Carcosa too, and their final combat-ready ships were defeated at the battle for Aragon Silo on 9 January 3304 by the Explorers' Nation fleet.</p>
<p>Under new leadership they contributed more peacefully to the first Thargoid refugee initiative, with the Amber Dock outpost originally constructed in April 3304 as a processing and temporary accommodation centre, though it is now more well known as a major hub for Colonia's service economy.</p>
<p>The Robardin Rock shipyards were of sufficient quality to be enhanced further as the Council concentrated on developing local ship-building in late 3303 and early 3304. In April 3305, when The Nameless regained operational control of the moonlet, they were able to negotiate licenses for some Alliance and Federal hulls, making Carcosa the only regional source of this equipment.</p>
<p>During 3306, disputes between The Nameless and other regional organisations, and claims that the Nameless were supporting criminal factions in the region, led to the reignition and rapid escalation of the Third Regional Conflict. While the overall result of this remains to be seen, in late September an alliance of multiple local groups and mercenaries hired from the bubble were able to recapture Robardin Rock and the other outposts, which are currently under the military control of the Societas Eruditorum de Civitas Dei.</p>
