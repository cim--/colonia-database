<p>Kopernik was founded early in the development of Colonia as its first dedicated surface extraction system, supplementing the facilities at Pennsylvania and the then small capabilities of Colonia Hub. The Winged Hussars, a large and organised group from the bubble, provided substantial quantities of supplies to the construction.</p>
<p>The Kolonia Sobieski surface base, named after the Polish hero of ancient Earth, specialises in Bertrandite, Goslarite, Pyrophyllite and Rutile. An additional settlement, Fernandes Oasis, was constructed further out to provide extra accommodation for tourists visiting the region.</p>
