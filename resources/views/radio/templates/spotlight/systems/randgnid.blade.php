<p>While there were small military bases at Garuda and Sovereign's Reach, the threats of possible invasions from the bubble led to the construction of dedicated military facilities in the Randgnid system – beginning with Templar Barracks, a stripped-down Orbis design – to house the Colonia Defense Force.</p>
<p>An auxiliary outpost was constructed a month later, with further expansion the following June to house the supplies donated by the Arek Crimson Vision Corporation in a military installation near Templar Barracks.</p>
<p>In August 3304, Templar Barracks was used to collect the materials required for the hydroponic facilities at Kinesi, requested by Professor Diana VanCleef. 1.2 million tonnes of cargo was consolidated at the station during the week, with the factories of Asura contributing a substantial fraction of the total as hundreds of freighters flew the route.</p>
<p>The system was a major centre contested during the Second Regional Conflict – though a temporary ceasefire was observed during the hydroponics initiative – with the eventual result being the transfer of routine security and policing operations to the Last Phoenix Vault organisation, leaving the Colonia Defence Force free to concentrate on potential external threats.</p>
<p>More recently the system has become well-known by miners for the extremely high Painite concentrations in the rings of Randgnid 4. While the demand for Painite has become somewhat saturated across the galaxy, it is still a popular spot.</p>
