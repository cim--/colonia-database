<p>The Nu Simbad group established Colonia's first prison colony to deal with the unfortunate demands of the growing criminal interest in the region, which was well-timed to house the pirates captured in Kojeara over the following week, in the fight against the unauthorised installations there.</p>
<p>The Chaydar Correctional surface base where the majority of prisoners are housed adds to the region's extraction and mining capabilities, providing substantial quantities of Bertrandite, Goslarite, Pyrophillite and Rutile. The local geology – and the need to provide reforming work for the prisoners – means that the majority of mining is carried out using explosive blasting of quarries, followed by manual sorting and collection of the rubble.</p>
<p>The system name references their parent Simbad group's home in the Taurus constellation, as seen from Sol.</p>
