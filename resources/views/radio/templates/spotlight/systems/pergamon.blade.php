<p>The Societas Eruditorum de Civitas Dei founded this system in early 3303, though first had to negotiate an early clerical error under which the Council originally gave them settlement rights to a different nearby ternary system with no planets.</p>
<p>Malcolm Oasis, positioned in the intersection of two ancient giant craters on a high-gravity world, produces a range of industrial goods, while Savorgnan Vision provides extra housing on a more comfortable low-gravity moon. The surface of Pergamon B2 is rich in high-purity silicates, which are used to produce the computer components needed for Colonia's many high-tech economies.</p>
<p>The system is home to crystalline and mollusc life, both in lagrange clouds and in a small region of B3's ring.</p>
<p>The Societas Eruditorum de Civitas Dei have been a prominent group in regional politics since early 3306, when their intervention against the No Look Here Gang in Pennsylvania, following up their earlier work in Kinesi against Sadie Capra Aegagrus, led them into direct conflict with the powerful Nameless group during the Third Regional Conflict.</p>
<p>While the majority of the fighting in this conflict has been around the Hephaestus and Carcosa systems, Pergamon itself has come under attack on a few occasions, leading SECD to call on assistance both from its associated Civitas Dei group in the bubble, and other mercenary forces.</p>
<p>The overall outcome of their attempts to suppress criminality and anarchism in the region is not yet known, but as a result they now control a substantial number of stations and systems to reinforce supply lines for the wars.</p>
