<p>Constructed by Los Services Ltd, Murakami Gateway does not have the same capacity as the larger Foster Terminal, but nevertheless forms an important part of the region's service sector, and a military installation was constructed in 3304 to defend the system further.</p>
<p>In the early days of the system, its isolated location meant regular courier runs were undertaken to the Diggidiggi system - its main connection to the hubs of Colonia. With the installation of more secure inter-system communications, these have reduced in number, and despite the system being omitted from the schedules of the region's logistics megaships, for a long time it only saw occasional supply ships.</p>
<p>In late 3304, this isolation and security made it an excellent choice for the unsociable Etienne Dorn, invited by the Council to work on high-tech research for the region's fleets. Kraken's Retreat, established by the engineer, now provides a range of advanced sensor and power supply tuning services - as well as the most advanced life support technology in the galaxy. Ironically, the steady flow of ships bringing research materials and collecting upgraded components has meant that the quietness that originally attracted Dorn has now gone, although he was able to convince the Council not to open an auxiliary carrier shipyard in the system.</p>
<p>In December 3306, the completion of Manifest Scanner research meant that Dorn became the second of the four local engineers to complete their part of the Council’s research programme, which had in March 3305 already produced a galactic breakthrough in lifesupport technology, and it is for its miniaturisation which Kraken’s Retreat is best known – able to provide a full life support system for an entire Beluga Liner in under ten tonnes.</p>
