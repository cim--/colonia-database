<p>Founded by the Mobius Colonial Republic Navy (MCRN) group as part of the Colonia Expansion Initiative, Pedersen's Legacy is on one of the smallest bodies of any planetary base in the region - a tiny metal-rich "potato" moon with a radius of only 332km, which led to it being included in the Colonia Trophy Dash race.</p>
<p>This industrial base produces a range of domestic and agricultural items for the region, and is supplemented by local mining operations at Rubruck Mines in the outer system.</p>
<p>Lagrange clouds near the system stars contain groups of Colonia's umbrella molluscs, with one cloud being unusually close to the Mobia B star, providing the ability to study these creatures in a higher-temperature environment.</p>
<p>The MCRN are one of Colonia's largest security providers, giving wide-ranging coverage across Mobia, Desy, Trakath and Hamlet's Harmony. Disputes over security in the Alberta system with the neighbouring Privateers' Alliance Expeditionary Force led to the first major regional conflict, though were eventually resolved diplomatically.</p>
<p>In mid-3304, the system was used as the base camp for the Reach from the Core expedition, a survey of several sites around the galactic core, as well as the Systeasi AR-C d1 system on the outer rim.</p>
