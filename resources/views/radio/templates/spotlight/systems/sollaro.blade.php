<p>This refinery system was set up by the Sollaro Refinery Operations group as part of Colonia's move to economic self-sufficiency. It is Colonia's smallest orbital refinery and provides low-capacity supplemental production only – other than Lithium, its capacity is only generally used when vast quantities of refined metals are needed for a specific project.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the system was initially quite prominent, with production online and sales opened just as the collection of materials for further Kojeara was stalling at the limits of Colonia's early economy – and had further visits when the Einheriar refugee project was underway.</p>
<p>With the system both relatively isolated – though convenient for ores transported from neighbouring Diggidiggi – and Annan Orbital having limited accommodation space, a civilian installation was constructed in 3304, and a tanker megaship serves to transport goods into and out of the system in bulk.</p>
<p>Sollaro Refinery Operations are structured federally and classified as a Confederacy by Universal Cartographics, but are a federation of corporations rather than the more usual federation of democratic bodies – a model based on the older refining specialists of INO Research.</p>
