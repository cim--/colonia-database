<p>This refinery system was set up by the Sollaro Refinery Operations group as part of Colonia's move to economic self-sufficiency. It is Colonia's smallest orbital refinery and provides low-capacity supplemental production only – other than Lithium, its capacity is only generally used when vast quantities of refined metals are needed for a specific project.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the system was initially quite prominent, with production online and sales opened just as the collection of materials for further Kojeara was stalling at the limits of Colonia's early economy – and had further visits when the Einheriar refugee project was underway.</p>
<p>With the system both relatively isolated – though convenient for ores transported from neighbouring Diggidiggi – and Annan Orbital having limited accommodation space, a civilian installation was constructed in 3304, and a tanker megaship serves to transport goods into and out of the system in bulk.</p>
<p>Sollaro Refinery Operations are structured federally and classified as a Confederacy by Universal Cartographics, but are a federation of corporations rather than the more usual federation of democratic bodies – a model based on the older refining specialists of INO Research.</p>
<p>Like many systems in this area, Sollaro became involved in the Third Regional Conflict, with the long-standing security control of the system by Explorers’ Nation being handed over to the Societas Eruditorum de Civitas Dei to provide a direct supply line between their home of Pergamon and their targets in Carcosa. The system itself was attacked at least twice during the conflict.</p>
<p>The security situation and its relatively distant location from the centre mean that trade visits to the refineries are relatively uncommon, and it is sometimes possible to pick up substantial quantities of rare refined goods such as Tritium or Insulating Membrane that have not been sold through freight contracts.</p>
