<p>Macrath Science and Research set up the Spassky's Prospect outpost in this system to provide additional High-Tech manufacturing in the region between Pyrrha and Ogmar. They are a feudal organisation, but have many rumoured links to Colonia's criminal underworld and its smuggling rings, and may have based their internal structures on those of the Smiling Dingo Crew.</p>
<p>The outpost specialises in production of Advanced Catalysers and Consumer Technology, and is also a centre for research into the commercial uses of meta-alloys – though, of course, supplies of these are generally rare. In 3304 the system, together with Luchtaine and Metztli, gained a Communications Installation to help coordinate inter-system information transfers.</p>
<p>Security control of the system has generally been managed by the Sovereignty organisation from the nearby Sovereign's Reach system – however, following the disputes of the second regional conflict, and the near-collapse of the Sovereignty's security forces, Macrath was temporarily placed under the administrative control ofthe Colonia Defence Force between November 3304 and February 3305. Following this the Sovereignty regained control, before ceding the system to the Galcop Colonial Defence Commission in September 3306.</p>
