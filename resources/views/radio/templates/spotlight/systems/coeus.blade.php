<p>The potential of Colonia to provide services to not just its own economy but all of human space was noted early on with the initial settlements at Trakath and Tenjin, but was only fully launched with the foundation of the Coeus system.</p>
<p>While most service work can be done electronically, for confidentiality physical data sometimes requires transfer, and so Foster Terminal - a decommissioned civilian cruiser - was used to house the many staff offices of the system's service organsiations. The external landing pads allow ships to dock and launch at higher speed than a conventional station, especially the lightweight courier craft most used for sending messages.</p>
<p>Oxley Orbital, a small industrial outpost, was built soon after to provide spare parts to Coeus and other systems in the region, and a Military Installation was built near Foster Terminal to provide additional protection to this strategic economic asset. Oxley's greatest specialisation is in HN Shock Mounts for the military, but it is perhaps more famous for providing tens of thousands of tonnes of Power Generators when they were needed to construct emergency accommodation for refugees from the Thargoid wars.</p>
<p>As Colonia's need for specialised components to equip its fleets increased, Coeus was chosen as the location for the region's manufactured materials brokerage. These small components are often imported from the bubble on the same courier ships that assist the service economy.</p>
<p>Foster Terminal's location inside an icy ring makes it a popular unofficial tourist destination, considered by many to be the most spectacular station in the region. The cruiser itself, however, has little to attract tourists, who mostly enjoy the view from the comfort of their tour ships. It is also a popular base with some miners, and regularly offers local mining contracts which are then distributed to the rest of the region on the LNL-257 bulk cargo carrier.</p>
