<p>The LGC Cartographers' Guild establised the Hipparque university base in this system as part of the Colonia Expansion Initiative. Scientific discovery had been acknowledged as a key aim for the new settlement since the set up of the Colonia Research Department and Research Division in the previous October, but it was only with Pytheas that the research community obtained dedicated purpose-built laboratories capable of supporting the larger exploration vessels.</p>
<p>The facility is much larger than the original research labs at Tenjin and Metztli, and includes its own high-tech manufacturing plants to construct most of what is needed for experimental labs on site. The surplus production from these plants - especially Muon Imager, Agri-Medicines and Aquaponic Systems - is sold to raise further research funding.</p>
