<p>The Explorers' Nation is a collaboration between the Corsairos de Heimdal and the Social Eleu Progressive Party, two exploration-oriented groups from the Sol region, who brought supplies together for the Colonia Expansion Initiative. Both Rebolo Port, named after the pre-hyperspace scientific leader Dr Rafael Rebolo Lopez, and the Union system itself were named in honour of the concepts of collaboration and cooperation.</p>
<p>Originally residential in nature, additional facilities were added during early 3303, with Szilard Depot opened to store and maintain military supplies for Colonia's defense. Refineries were brought online in May, as the region moved towards self-sufficiency, providing Liquid Oxygen to many of the nearby systems, as well as Beryllium and Semiconductors for Colonia's industries. As there are few major mining facilities nearby, the ores imported from Aurora Astrum are supplemented by asteroid mining in Union itself.</p>
<p>Human habitation in the Union system is largely restricted to the primary star, to avoid disturbing the umbrella molluscs and other simpler space life near Union B.</p>
<p>During the Third Regional Conflict the system was the site of intense fighting between the Nameless and security forces for several months, which only ended after the Societas Eruditorum forces took temporary direct control of system security here and used Sollaro to establish a stronger supply chain. Eventually the Nameless were forced to retreat – after multiple attempts and the intervention of mercenary groups from the bubble on both sides – at the end of August 3306.</p>
<p>However, exhaustion with the conflict led to a surprise victory for Einheriar Agri-Works Ltd in elections two months later, followed by a by-election win for the Likedeeler of Colonia, who currently manage the system.</p>
