<p>The Hutton Truckers were used to the requirements of long-distance travel from their home system of Alpha Centauri, and so applied those skills to bring supplies out to Colonia as well. They maintain the Fort Mug industrial settlement in this system, on the Hutton Moon planet â€“ named after the famous Hutton Orbital and its unusual Hutton Mugs.</p>
<p>The Colonia region does not have the materials to construct mugs locally, and despite importing vast quantities of copper, lithium and insulating membrane, the Truckers have as yet not developed a local alternative.</p>
<p>Fort Mug was chosen in 3305 as one of the waypoints on the Colonia Trophy Dash, as the final planetary landing on the circuit. Due to the imperfect tidal locking of Hutton Moon, the station spends extended periods in darkness, making racing challenging in some months.</p>
