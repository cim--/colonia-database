<p>Founded by the Last Phoenix Vault early in the Colonia Expansion Initiative, The Nest was at the time Colonia's largest refinery station, using the high surface gravity of Phoenix 2a for highly efficient gravity-assisted refining - a successful method copied later for the nearby Chrysus and Santos Dumont facilities.</p>
<p>While later operations at Kojeara, Luchtaine and Sollaro have meant that it is no longer the region's sole large source of refined metals, it still produces a significant amount of Copper and Titanium, much of which goes to the nearby military facilities at Randgnid.</p>
<p>To give workers a break from the high-gravity conditions, and to provide spare parts for the refining stacks, an industrial settlement has been constructed at Rossi Depot, on one of the young system's few lightweight bodies.</p>
<p>In addition to their pioneering work in refining techniques, the Last Phoenix Vault also took advantage of their independence from the bubble to set up new forms of internal governance - while Universal Cartographics classifies them as a Patronage, their governance is on corporate rather than the more rigid hierarchical lines defining a bubble Patronage. This arrangement proved successful and has been adopted by other Colonia partners since.</p>
<p>On 3 March 3304 security operations at The Nest were temporarily placed under military rule by The Sovereignty group. This was locally highly unpopular and control of system security was returned to Last Phoenix Vault on 24 April. This marked the start of the second regional conflict, which also saw extended disagreements between the two groups over security provision in nearby Randgnid.</p>
