<p>In mid-3304 research into the long-term sustainability of Colonia was carried out for the Council by Professors Alexei de la Vega and Diana VanCleef. This made a recommendation for increased hydroponic provision, and supplies to equip a new centre were collected at Randgnid.</p>
<p>By the end of August, a new hydroponics facility had been constructed in Kinesi. Built from a surplus Orbis habitation ring, it is one of the largest producers of agricultural goods in the region. Like the region's original hydroponics facility in Metztli, it orbits an earthlike world to allow sampling of suitable native edible plants and animals without interference with the ecosystem. It now forms part of the Colonia Trophy Dash racing circuit.</p>
<p>With a large number of new citizens needing to be settled, the Council took the opportunity to construct other infrastructure in Kinesi, making use of suitable natural resources. Crevie's Salvo, a hollowed out asteroid, produces additional military hardware for the protection of the region - though services for visitors are extremely limited and most ships only stay long enough to transfer cargo.</p>
<p>Two major habitats have been constructed to hold the system's large population - Dallin's Boondocks provides surface facilities on an outer moon, while the New Queen VI installation provides orbital housing with a spectacular low-orbit view of the earthlike. A further agricultural installation has also been constructed to increase hydroponics capacity.</p>
<p>The rapid construction of such a large system led to opportunities for criminals, with the Sadie Capra Aegagrus organisation setting up an unauthorised installation around Kinesi 3a, and damaging other attempted constructions at 3b. The Societas Eruditorum de Civitas Dei organisation based in nearby Pergamon was given responsibility for security management and under their leadership, the unauthorised installation was successfully dismantled.</p>
