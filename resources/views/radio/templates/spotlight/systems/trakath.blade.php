<p>Originally intended as a mining outpost, a shortage of equipment after Desy and Pennsylvania had been provisioned led to Diva Mines eventually being set up as a service outpost, providing administrative support to the rest of the region. This accidental change turned out to be very beneficial to Colonia, as services were much easier to sell outside the region than commodities would have been, and it allowed funding of further early developments, and encouraged  development of Colonia's now substantial services economy.</p>
<p>The system's central location and quantity of metallic terrestrial worlds nevertheless meant that it was still intended to become a mining system. A small prospecting operation was set up at Rowley Survey in early 3303, but large scale extraction did not start until the construction of the Safe Haven outpost in April 3304. This facility, named by the refugees from the Thargoids who make up the majority of its population, is now one of the region's largest producers of Coltan.</p>
<p>Additional capacity and storage was added with the construction of an industrial installation in June 3304, and bulk carriers transport much of the system's production directly to the refineries of Kojeara and Luchtaine. The system is a major logistics hub, with many opportunities for independent pilots to supplement the work of the bulk fleet.</p>
