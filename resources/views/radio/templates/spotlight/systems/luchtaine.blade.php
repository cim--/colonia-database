<p>This extensive refinery system was established in June 3303 by the Luchtaine Forge group to provide a reliable source of the metals and other products required by Colonia's high-tech and manufacturing economies. For efficiency, Moore's Charm was established within the rings of Luchtaine 1, by hollowing out a large asteroid. Miners can obtain many basic ores and deliver them to the station without ever leaving the ring - a convenience later repeated in the Alberta system. The navigational challenges of approaching the ring led to Mooreâ€™s Charm becoming an early stop on the Colonia Trophy Dash racing circuit.</p>
<!-- <p>Additional refining capacity was added at Neugebauer Mines a month later - while Moore's Charm specialises in <wait for analysis>, Neugebauer produces <wait for analysis>.</p> -->
<p>In November 3303 a rare failure in operational security allowed terrorists to ambush a Banner Class cargo ship delivering raw materials to the refineries. They were able to rapidly disable the freighter, capturing several crew but largely ignoring the cargo before system authority and rescue transports were able to reach the scene. The motivation for the attack remains a mystery. A large amount of cargo remains aboard, as well as the escape pods of many of the former crew. While after over two years recovery of further survivors is not expected, salvage and rescue operations are encouraged.</p>
<p>The system's importance led to further development, with a Communications Installation being added in June 3304, and two further bulk freighters being obtained to replace and supplement the lost one, connecting the system strongly to Colonia's logistics hubs and to the major consumers of refined products in Randgnid, Asura, Macrath and Coeus.</p>
<p>The strong economy then led to Mel Brandon choosing it as the location for his engineering workshop. The Brig provides an extensive range of upgrades of shields, drives, frameshift and laser technology for Colonia's fleets, with developments in shield cell bank and FSD interdictor refinements which exceed the performance of any other provider. With the support of the Colonia Council and many local pilots supplying materials, Brandon was able to complete his research programme and make The Brig fully operational at the start of 3306 - the first of the region's four engineers to do so.</p>
