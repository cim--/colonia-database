<p>Alberta Industries were appointed by the Council to set up the Kraft Works industrial outpost in this system, to provide additional basic manufacturing capacity for the region. It produces a wide range of machinery, with atmospheric processors, crop harvesters and skimmer components being in particularly high supply.</p>
<p>In early 3304, the Berman Market refinery was set up in the rings of one of the system's gas giants, significantly strengthening the system's economy, as well as providing accommodation for refugees fleeing the Thargoid conflict of the bubble. Its location provides easy access for local miners, with Bertrandite and Gallite especially popular, and provides a range of materials for Kraft Works and the surrounding systems. In June 3304 a Civilian Installation was constructed near Alberta 2, to provide more comfortable accommodation for the system's growing population.</p>
<p>The system's location and economic value led to Colonia's first regional conflict. The Mobius Colonial Republic Navy (MCRN) and the Privateers Alliance Expeditionary Force (PAEX) had both been looking to obtain additional system security contracts, and had an informal agreement that MCRN would bid for Desy, and PAEX for Alberta. In September 3303, however, MCRN were awarded the contract for Alberta as well.</p>
<p>A series of disputes then followed, with PAEX obtaining the Desy contract in November 3303, followed by the Alberta contract in December 3303. Further appeals from MCRN led to them retaking both contracts in February 3304, before finally diplomatic discussions took place and the Alberta contract was transferred back to PAEX in July 3304. Since then, relationships between the two organisations have become much stronger.</p>
