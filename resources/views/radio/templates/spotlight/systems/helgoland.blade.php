<p>The Likedeeler are one of the largest Imperial organisations in the bubble, based around the Michel system, and constructed a settlement at Stoertebecker Dock in Helgoland as part of the Colonia Expansion Initiative – the second Empire-associated group to do so. As with all Colonia groups, the Likedeeler of Colonia are formally independent of all superpowers, and their democratic structure constrasts with the traditional Imperial Patronage structure of their Michel partner.</p>
<p>The high-tech facilities at Stoertebecker Dock produce a wide range of goods for the nearby economies, including large amounts of Animal Monitors, Auto-Fabricators and Muon Imager.</p>
<p>Stoertebecker Dock is named after the ancient privateer Klaus Störtebeker whose drinking habits have inspired much of the Likedeeler’s presence and methods.</p>
