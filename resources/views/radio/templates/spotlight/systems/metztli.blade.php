<p>One of the most urgent tasks in the early stages of Colonia was to establish a reliable food supply. However, the settlers were aware that the history of human colonisation – Tau Ceti, Achenar, Lave, and many other places in the bubble – showed that settlement of Earth-like worlds was generally very bad for the native life.</p>
<p>Metztli, as one of the closest ELWs to Colonia, was to be the start of a new approach. The Colonia Research Division set up a small research station in orbit around Metztli 6, to begin the advanced hydroponics research Colonia is now famous for. By growing and breeding suitable specimens in orbit, they were able to supply a small amount of food to the rest of the region without harming the planetary ecosystem - although the majority of meals in the first year were still basic synthetic food cartridges, produced in bulk at Colonia Hub.</p>
<p>Concern over the sourcing of the vast quantities of water used by the hydroponics facility led to the construction of Moore Works, a specialised mining facility on an uninhabited icy moon. This now provides a substantial surplus of water to the system, both for sale to independent traders, and via an Aquarius-class tanker to several other systems.</p>
<p>To assist the continuing research, a communications installation was constructed in June 3304 to allow better reporting of performance data from Colonia's agricultural centres, and the system is served by Colonia's only Lowell-class research ship. The technology developed at Vitto Orbital now provides most of Colonia's food, from systems which previously would never have been considered for agricultural production.</p>
