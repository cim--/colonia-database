<p>In the early days of Colonia cartographics services were rare. Nowadays, a wide range of stations provide these services - for historical reasons, the <a href="{{route('stations.show', 2)}}">Colonia Hub</a> surface base in Colonia and the <a href="{{route('stations.show', 7)}}">Colonia Dream</a> Coriolis in Ratraii do not, and nor do most stations in the specialist hydroponics hub of Kinesi.</p>

<p>The Colonia region is near to numerous larger and planetary nebula in the Festival Grounds area, and is just above a large neutron field. As a well-equipped settlement with a reasonably central position, it makes an excellent base for expeditions to most of the galaxy.</p>

<p>Lagrange clouds are common around the nebula, including species of umbrella mollusc. The Holloway Biosciences Institute has begun a research programme, and will gladly pay for samples collected using Research Limpets.</p>
