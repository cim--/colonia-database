<h2>Outfitting and Shipyards.</h2>

<p>With the construction of the Colonia Applied Research facility, the region is capable of producing <a href='{{route('outfitting')}}'>almost all outfitting components</a>, though availability will depend somewhat on local stock levels and economic situations. Ships designed by the Federation, Empire and Alliance may be harder to come by, though certain criminal organisations have been known to obtain mostly-legitimate second-hand hulls.</p>
	  
<p>Long-range shipping of items from the Sol region is possible, but due to the low demand, high distance, and excessive insurance requirements, this is exceedingly expensive - generally over 30% more than the items cost themselves! In general it's better to buy locally wherever possible, even if this may occasionally mean using a slightly less effective component.</p>

<p>Drake-class Carriers can be purchased from the capital shipyards at Jaques station, and auxiliary shipyards capable of refits are in the Asura, Deriso, Luchtaine, Ratraii and Tir systems.</p>
