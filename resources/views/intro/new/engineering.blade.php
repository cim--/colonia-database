	  <h2>Engineering</h2>

<p>Colonia has <a href='{{route('engineers.index')}}'>rapidly improving engineering options</a> locally, and with the permission of a Sol region engineer, remote workshops are available and can be used to supplement local provision. Exclusive blueprints are available for the Shield Cell Bank, Interdictor, Life Support and Fuel Scoop modules.</p>

<p>The Council has convinced a number of technology and material brokers that the region is worth setting up operations in, and these are based as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data: Colonia Dream, Ratraii.</li>
  <li>Raw: TolaGarf's Junkyard, Kojeara.</li>
  <li>Manufactured: Foster Terminal, Coeus.</li>
  <li>Human Tech: Bolden's Enterprise, Tir.</li>
  <li>Guardian Tech: Jaques Station, Colonia.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to conventional sources of engineering materials, some <a href='{{route('installations.index')}}'>installations</a> have satellites which can be scanned for data, and miscellaneous manufactured materials (as well as some cargoes required by the Tech Brokers) can be found in the debris around the <a href='{{route('megaships.show',9)}}'>wrecked bulk carrier</a> in Luchtaine or in its cargo holds. Recovery of salvage from this ship is authorised by the Council.</p>
