<h2>Colonial Research and Science</h2>
<p>Colonia's position in the galaxy and local vacuum life-forms led to it being a centre of exploration research from the early days, while its isolation and independence has made it attractive to any researcher concerned about their results offending a superpower. There are several major research facilities in the region, with a range of specialities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balakor's Research Post: local astrography and biology</li>
<li>Hipparque - Cartographer's University: exploration and surveying</li>
<li>Dove Enigma: xenobiology</li>
<li>Tir Research Labs: economics and sustainability</li>
<li>The Brig, The Watchtower, Krakenâ€™s Retreat and Sanctuary: ship construction</li>
<li>Colonia Applied Research: engineering</li>
<li>Holloway Bioscience Institute: vacuum life-forms</li>
</ul>
