<h2>Colonial Research and Science.</h2>
<p>Colonia's position in the galaxy and local vacuum life-forms led to it being a centre of exploration research from the early days, while its isolation and independence has made it attractive to any researcher concerned about their results offending a superpower. There are several major research facilities in the region, with a range of specialities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balakor's Research Post: local astrography and biology.</li>
<li>Hipparque - Cartographer's University: exploration and surveying.</li>
<li>Dove Enigma: xenobiology.</li>
<li>Tir Research Labs: economics and sustainability.</li>
<li>The Brig, The Watchtower, Krakenâ€™s Retreat and Sanctuary: ship construction.</li>
<li>Colonia Applied Research: engineering.</li>
<li>Holloway Bioscience Institute: vacuum life-forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the research programmes are at an early stage, there have
been some notable successes. In technology, Colonia has managed
to develop improvements to shield cell banks, fuel scoops,
interdictors, refineries and life support systems which have
exceeded those publicly available in the Sol region. The Tir
Research Labs supported the development of crucial hydroponics
infrastructure which has minimised food shortages in the region.
Many expeditions have used Colonia as a base for their operations,
providing valuable data on previously lightly-explored regions, and
benefiting from the easier logistics.</p>
