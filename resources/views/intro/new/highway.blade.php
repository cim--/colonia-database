<h2>The Colonia Highway.</h2>
<p>To provide resupply facilities for ships travelling between Colonia and Sol, two sets of stations have been set up. A large fleet of support ships travels between Colonia and these stations on a 12-week cycle, to ensure that they remain well-stocked and to rotate crew.</p>
<p>The first set, consisting of six mostly-automated surface bases, was constructed in late 3302 with the assistance of Latugara PLC to provide accommodation and rest for freighter crews supplying the early settlement.</p>
<p>These facilities - Polo Harbour, Gagarin Gate, Sacaqawea Space Port, Eagle's Landing, Amundsen Terminal and Hillary Depot - are generally positioned in or near nebulae on the route between the two regions, and have very basic facilities. They are directly administered by the Colonia Council.</p>
<p>A second set of stations, in the Kashyapa, Gandharvi and Rohini systems, was constructed in late 3303 by the Kamadhenu Chapterhouse of Inquisition, to provide support for the Blue Star Line freight and passenger service. These systems each contain a large Orbis starport and a secondary outpost, near Earth-like Worlds surveyed by Chapterhouse officials.</p>
<p>These systems - while strongly backed by Imperial interests and run under traditional Imperial Patronage governments - are at least nominally independent of the Empire, and much more dependent in the short-term on Colonia-based resupply. The Colonia Council maintains offices in the systems for diplomatic purposes.</p>
