<h2>Economics of Colonia.</h2>
<p>Colonia's economy is very different to that of the Sol region. Once self-sufficiency was acheived, surplus production has primarily been in areas which can usefully be exported - High-Tech manufactured components which can be in short supply in the bubble, Tourism visits to the region's sights, and a strong Service economy providing off-sector backups and other services to many bubble systems.</p>
<p>Within the region, modern facilities and techniques allow productivity to be over five times higher per person than in the Sol region. A sizable fleet of bulk carriers serves the major factory systems, with Colonia being used as a hub to move goods to and from trade and resupply vessels that travel all the way to the Sol region.</p>
<p>Currently the regional population is low enough that there has been no need to consider terraforming to provide space, and advanced hydroponics technology allows Colonia to be fed without requiring interference with the native planetary life. Environmentalist movements - remembering the consequences of Federal, Imperial or Alliance colonisation of their planets - call for a complete ban on such interference, though so far the Council considers it premature to take a formal stance.</p>
