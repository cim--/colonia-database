<h2>Piracy and Espionage</h2>

<p>A large number of <a href='{{route('megaships.index')}}'>megaships</a> are maintained by the Council for logistics purposes, both to transport cargo within Colonia, and to maintain the Highway stations towards Sol.</p>

<p>These ships carry rare cargoes and localised cargoes which are sometimes in great demand in the region either on the conventional markets or for tech brokers.</p>

<p>There are also a very large number of <a href='{{route('installations.index')}}'>installations</a>, used by the Council to provide facilities separate to the primary orbital stations. The cargo holds and data transmitters of these are also vulnerable to pirates.</p>

<p>The usual opportunities for pirates to intercept courier ships are also available.</p>

<p>Obviously, the Council does not condone this activity, and interference with these facilities is strictly illegal.</p>
