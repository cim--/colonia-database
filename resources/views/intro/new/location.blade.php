<p>The Colonia region is within the Eol Prou sector approximately 22,000 LY from Sol, near the border of the Inner Scutum-Centaurus Arm with the Odin's Hold region of the galactic core. The most prominent feature is the nebula, which is over 50 LY across, and sits within a dense cluster of B-class stars.</p>
	  
<p>A set of 6 surface resupply outposts and a newer set of 3 orbital stations break the journey from Sol into easier and shorter stages, and the neutron highways are well mapped.</p>
	  
<p>The populated region now consists of {{$systemcount}} systems and is approximately 100 LY in diameter. Visitors are recommended to take some time to look around - the entire region can be visited in a few days - and get their bearings.</p>
