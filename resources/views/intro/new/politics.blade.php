<h2>Politics of Colonia</h2>
<p>The Colonia region is run primarily on Cooperative lines, with the Colonia Council being a cooperative of the regional partner organisations for region-wide matters such as trade and foreign policy, maintenance of some critical regional infrastructure, and public relations.</p>
<p>The region is firmly independent of all bubble powers and superpowers, but does have some allies within the bubble in systems such as Latugara and Arek who sympathise with the aims of Colonia and have provided supplies at key times.</p>
<p>The superpowers themselves have likewise largely ignored Colonia. The Alliance has very few connections, even informally, with the region, and the Federation little more (though the Earth Expeditionary Fleet does have links to a prominent Federal militia).</p>
<p>The Empire has shown more interest - funding a trade route between the two regions, and providing support to a few of the partner organsiations. There have also been various Imperial outcasts, including many supporters of the late Senator Loren, who have settled in the region.</p>
<p>Internal political matters have generally been resolved through diplomatic means, even between partner organisations with very different structures, and rarely approach the levels of open warfare seen in the Sol region. Nevertheless, the Council recognises that they are not entirely avoidable, and so concentrates on ensuring that they do not disrupt key infrastructure when they do occur.</p>
