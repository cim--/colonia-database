<h2>Trading.</h2>

<p>Compared with the Sol region, High-Tech and Service economies are much more common. On the other hand, there are not yet any Terraforming economies - the settlement is small enough not to need the extra living space yet. Colony economies are also very rare - in general, Tourism economies have taken their place.</p>

<p>None of the systems have a high population so supply and demand levels for goods are generally low - however, many of the outlying systems also have low traffic levels, so surpluses and deficits can build up.</p>

<p>Decent profits can be made on relatively short journeys for those who <a href="{{route('reserves')}}">know where to look</a>, and <a href="{{route('reports.traffic')}}">prioritise less serviced markets</a>. The additional profits enabled in the Sol bubble through the policies of particular Powers are of course not available, but the strong Colonia economy makes this less necessary.</p>

<p>There is only one rare good - Jaques Quinentian Stills - and the radius of the Colonia region is too small for sales to be profitable anywhere locally. It's worth picking some up if you plan a side trip to Kashyapa or Polo Harbour, though.</p>
