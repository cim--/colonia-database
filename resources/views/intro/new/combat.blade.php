<p>Bounty hunters are always required in the region, as pirates look for easy pickings around navigation beacons and at resource extraction sites, while mercenaries can find regular work in the minor conflicts between partner organisations. There are also many <a href='{{route('installations.index')}}'>installations</a> and <a href='{{route('megaships.index')}}'>megaships</a> in the region, including some Unauthorised Installations, which occasionally require defending.</p>

<p>Some local criminals may have travelled here to escape a bounty in the Federation, Alliance, or Empire. There are no local offices for these superpowers, so you will either need to save them for a trip back to the Sol region, or employ an Interstellar Factor to do this for you.</p>
